## Basic Architecture and Setup

I'm using four mini PCs with a very minimalistic installation of Ubuntu Server.

I made sure that all of the servers have current user created and I can login using a temporary password. This is essential for
the first part of the setup process.

### Prepare the hosts

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbooks/prepare.up.yml -K
```

### Install some tools

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbooks/tools_up.yml
```
